                    <p>Hi, my name &#40;as you could probably tell from the header&#41; is Adam Lowe. I'm 19, and I've had an
                         interest in coding for about as long as I can remember</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>If someone where to ask me where my interest in coding came from, I'd probably think a bit,
                         because I'm fairly certain that traces of my interest came from when I was only 4</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>4 was somewhere around the time when I got a gameboy, my first exposure to videogames, and I
                         fell in love completely. At some point, a curosity for the thing I loved developed. Which was
                          probably the gunpowder for what eventually became my love for coding.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>However, I very clearly remember the spark that sent me soaring headfirst into my desire for a career in the subject. I was in elementary school, and our teacher was going around the room asking what the other kids wanted to be when they grew up
                        as she went around, she finally got to my table. She turned to the kid next to me asks "What do you want to be when you grow up?" this kid doesn't hesitate to say: "Video game champion!" she just smiled at him, and then turned to me and asked the same question.
                        "And what about you Adam?" I remember thinking that what the last kid said sounded all well and good, so of course I parroted him and also said "Video game champion!" she smiled at me, but didn't turn to the next kid, instead she let silence hang for moment before saying
                        "Really? Actually Adam, I always imagined that you'd become the next Bill Gates". Of course, I had no idea who this was, so I googled him later, and what I found led me to learn more about what coding actually was and that was what finally led to me thinking "I WILL grow up to be like him!"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And the rest can be summed up pretty quickly
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I went from Elementary, to Middle, then to High-School with my love of coding only growing &#40;Despite knowing next to nothing about how to actually do it&#41; I graduated early, took some novice-level self-guided lessons while holding a part-time job at a pizza place. All the while looking for
                        a more intensive, thorough, class on the subject.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From there? You can probably guess the rest-
